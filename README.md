### Money

For the last few years, in addition to my teaching work, I have been self employed as a handyman, decorator and gardener - installing kitchens, painting houses and restaurants, assisting a tree surgeon etc. It has been brilliant but confusing. Before this I worked in pubs and resaturants since I was a teenager...
